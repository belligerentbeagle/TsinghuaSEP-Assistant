# TSINGHUA SEP AI Assistant

Welcome to the TSINGHUA SEP AI Assistant! This project aims to provide an intelligent assistant for students going for the Tsinghua SEP.

> Developer note: I created this because I was annoyed at the lack of clear, centralised instructions and decided to pull the crazy amounts of random pieces of information in one place, and create a QA interface.

## Features

- Special hyperlink functions that open buttons in new tabs.
